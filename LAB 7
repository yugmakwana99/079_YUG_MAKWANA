a.	Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 2 to 10.
Code:-import numpy as np
matrix = np.arange(2, 11).reshape(3, 3) print(matrix)

b.	Write a NumPy program to reverse an array (the first element becomes the last).
Code:-import numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) reversed_arr = arr[::-1]
print("Reversed Array:", reversed_arr)

c.	Write a NumPy program to find common values between two arrays.
Code:- import numpy as np arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
arr2 = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6])
common = np.intersect1d(arr1, arr2) print("Common Values:", common)

d.	Write a NumPy program to repeat array elements.
Code:- import numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3]) repeated = np.repeat(arr, 2)
print("Repeated Elements:", repeated) 

e.	Write a NumPy program to find the memory size of a NumPy array.
Code:- import numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) memory_size = arr.nbytes
print("Memory Size (bytes):", memory_size

f.	Write a NumPy program to create an array of ones and zeros.
Code:- import numpy as np zeros_array = np.zeros(5) ones_array = np.ones(5)
 print("Zeros:", zeros_array) print("Ones:", ones_array) 

g.	Write a NumPy program to find the 4th element of a specified array.
Code:- import numpy as np
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]) fourth_element = arr[3]
print("4th Element:", fourth_element)
